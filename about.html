      <h3>Social Economic Strategy</h3>

      <p>We have incorporated government policies in creating employment. We have adopted
        employment policies to create the kind of jobs that upskill, empower, and transfer skills
        to benefit previously disadvantaged communities. Our program supports B-BBEE in
        eradicating unemployment in our communities through mentorship, internship, voluntary
        appointments and contractual work depending on the projects that are active.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have committed part of our revenue to support NPOs in a form of giving back to the community.

      <p>
        We fully support initiatives that exist to better the lives of humanity, from green building initiatives,
        human settlement, child protection, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Tholakwande Group (Pty) Ltd we believe human capital is the major resource any
        entity will require, that is why we will continue to empower, inspire, motivate and engage
        everyone in expanding that resource for the future of humankind and business.

        regulations protecting the environment are a minimum to executing business.
